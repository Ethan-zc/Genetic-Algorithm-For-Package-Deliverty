# Genetic-Algorithm-For-Package-Delivery
This project introduces a new prioritized package deliv-
ery problem (PPDP) that given topology, demands, and avail-
able postmen with different speeds on different roads, we want
to minimize the total delivery cost, taking into account the
package priorities. A generic algorithm is proposed to solve
the PPDP, which integrates the Dijkstra algorithm and differ-
ent crossover and mutation methodologies. The Dijkstra algo-
rithm aims to find the shortest path from the source node to
each possible destination node, which helps build the cost ma-
trix for each postman. Then, a genetic algorithm is applied
to find the optimal solution for this question, and experiments
with different crossover and mutations are conducted to com-
pare the efficiency. Computational experiments on various in-
stances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively
solve the PPDP.
